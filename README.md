## [Scheduler](https://github.com/bran214/Scheduler)
This is an application to model a Scheduler, similar to a standard calendar. However, the Scheduler functions differently since it asks for how long an event will last, rather than when it starts and ends. It shows exactly where the event can fit in the schedule, allowing for better planning for fitting tasks into a day.

## [SpaceGame](https://github.com/bran214/SpaceGame)
This is a game in which you pilot a spaceship through a field of asteroids, and then battle an enemy spaceship. Move the spaceship by moving your mouse and fire your weapons by clicking the mouse. A powerup you can collect during the game is an orbiter, which will orbit your ship and fire its weapons along with it.
